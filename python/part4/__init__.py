Part 4: Discrete-Time LQR Controller Design with Reduced Input (u3 Removed)

This module implements a discrete-time infinite-horizon LQR controller for the
6-mass spring system with the third input u3 removed. The controller uses
estimated states from the Part 2 observer and minimizes the same cost as Part 3.
