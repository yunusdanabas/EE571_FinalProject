# Agent Prompt Template for Part X

**Copy this prompt and replace X with the part number (0-7) and [PART_NAME] with the part name.**

---

Work on final/partX/ following the instructions in partX_plan.md.

**Your tasks:**
1. Read `final/partX/partX_plan.md` for specific instructions
2. Read the original implementation in `python/partX/` 
3. Check `final/utils/` for existing functions - reuse or add new ones at the end of files if needed
4. Create simplified code in `final/partX/[PART_NAME].py` - remove verbose validation, use utils functions, keep minimal humanized comments
5. Run the code to generate outputs in `final/partX/outputs/`
6. Create `final/partX/partX_report.md` with objective, approach, key results, and findings

**Key principles:**
- Simplify code structure but keep math/algorithms unchanged
- Use parameterized utils functions when possible
- Never modify original `python/` files
- Keep reports concise but informative

Refer to `final/anchor.md` for code style guidelines and workflow details.
